[Verse]

D                          E      F#

I’ve been searching for you

I heard a cry within my soul

I’ve never heard a yearning quite

Like this before

Know that you are

Walking right through my door

 

 

[Chorus]

Asus2       F#m11              E

All of my life where have you been

              D

I wonder if I’ll ever see you again

And if that day comes, I know we could win

I wonder if I’ll ever see you again

 

 

[Verse]

A sacred gift from heaven

For better worse whenever

And I would never let somebody

Break you down

Or take you crown,

Never

 

 

[Chorus]

Asus2       F#m11              E

All of my life where have you been

              D

I wonder if I’ll ever see you again

And if that day comes, I know we could win

I wonder if I’ll ever see you again

 

 

[Bridge] (a cappella)

Am

(Through time)

I’ve always known

           Em

(That you were there) 

Upon your throne

(A lonely queen)

Without her king

(I longed for you)

My love, forever!
