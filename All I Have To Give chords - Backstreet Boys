[Verse 1]
        F    G        Am7
I don't know what he does to make you cry, 
      F           G             Em    F
but I'll be there to make you smile. 
          F     G      G/B
I don't have a fancy car, 
C                Bbmaj7           Em7  Am
to get to you I'd walk a thousand miles. 
         F    G     Am7
I don't care if he buys you nice things 
           F      G               Em   F
Does his gifts come from the heart-
         F     G            Bbmaj7
I don't know But if you were my girl... 
C                   E7        Am
I'd make it so we'd never be apart. 
 
[Chorus]
                F    G       Am7
But my love is all I have to give 
                F        G     Em   F
Without you I don't think I can live 
                F        G        G/B
I wish I could give the world to you...
C                 Bbmaj7    Gsus
but Love is all I have to give 
 
[Verse 2]
When you talk-does it seem like he's not
even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problens
I'll try my best to kiss them all away...
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please...I'm on my knees
praying for the day that you'll be mine
 
[Chorus]
(But my love is all...)
C    G/B    C       F                 G/B    C      F6

Am7   G/B         C            F                  G/B     C
          All the money in the world could never add up to 
         Bbmaj7       Em7    Am       F
all the love I have inside...I Love You
