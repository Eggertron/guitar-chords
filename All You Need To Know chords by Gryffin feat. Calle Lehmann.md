# All you need to know

```
[Verse 1]
Am            F
Simple as can be
                       C
I got your hands in mine
G                     Am             F
And you don't have to listen carefully
                         C
I'll tell you a thousand times
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
               Am                 F
Anything you feel, put it all on me
            C
All of your thoughts, I want everything
                  Am                      F
And when you get sad, like you do sometimes
               C
Put it all on me
              Am
Put it all on me
 
 
[Chorus]
     F                              C
I'll lift you when you're feeling low
                                  Am
I'll hold you when the night gets cold
       F                    C
You'll never have to be alone
                   G         Am
And that's all you need to know
   F                            C
No love lost, we've got you and I
                    G             Am
No clouds, we shoot them out the sky
       F                    C
You'll never have to be alone
                             Am F C
And that's all you need to know
                             Am F C
And that's all you need to know
 
And that's all you need to know
 
 
[Verse 2]
Am            F
Simple as can be
                  C
I'm gonna be around
G                   Am               F
And you know we got everything we need
                   C
Look at this thing we found
 
[Pre-Chorus]
               Am                 F
Anything you feel, put it all on me
                    C
Your fears and your thoughts, give me all of it
                  Am                      F
And when you get sad, like you do sometimes
               C
Put it all on me
              Am
Put it all on me
 
 
[Chorus]
     F                              C
I'll lift you when you're feeling low
                                  Am
I'll hold you when the night gets cold
       F                    C
You'll never have to be alone
                   G         Am
And that's all you need to know
   F                            C
No love lost, we've got you and I
                    G             Am
No clouds, we shoot them out the sky
       F                    C
You'll never have to be alone
                             Am F C
And that's all you need to know
                             Am F C
And that's all you need to know
 
And that's all you need to know

And you don't have to listen carefully
                         C
