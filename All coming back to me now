There were nights when the wind was so cold
        Dm            Em
That my body froze in bed
            Am
If I just listened to it
Dm                   F    Gsus4 G
Right outside the window
           C                        F
There were days when the sun was so cruel
             Dm              Em
That all the tears turned to dust
           Am
And I just knew my eyes were
Dm             F  C  G
Drying up forever
 
Em          Am           F       G        C
I finished crying in the instant that you left
      Em             Am               F  G Gsus4
And I can't remember where or when or how
      Em             Am             F     G    Fsus2   G
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
 
             C
But when you touch me like this
        G/B
And you hold me like that
        Am7     Dm7
I just have to admit
          Fmaj7      Gsus4
That it's all coming back to me
        C
When I touch you like this
      G
And I hold you like that
        Am7       Dm7
It's so hard to believe but
     Fmaj7     Gsus4
It's all coming back to me
 
      C                                F
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
            Am7         F
There were moments of gold
               Em            F
And there were flashes of light
           Am7                  F
There were things I'd never do again
                Em              F
But then they'd always seemed right
           Am                Em7
There were nights of endless pleasure
        Am           F       Dm
It was more than any laws allow
F/G
Baby Baby
 
     C
If I kiss you like this
           G/B
And if you whisper like that
       Am7        Dm7
It was lost long ago
         Fmaj7      Gsus4
But it's all coming back to me
       C
If you want me like this
           G/B
And if you need me like that
       Am7        Dm7
It was dead long ago
         Fmaj7      Gsus4
But it's all coming back to me
        Am7     Dm7
It's so hard to resist
         Fmaj7      Gsus4
And it's all coming back to me
      Am7      Dm7
I can barely recall
         F          Dm/G        Am
But it's all coming back to me now
 
G/B  C/F  F  Dm    G/B  C/F  F  Dm
 
 
                 C                         F
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
        Dm                Em
And whenever you tried to hurt me
       Am            Dm
I just hurt you even worse
            F    Gsus4 G
And so much deeper
           C                           F
There were hours that just went on for days
      Dm                Em               Am
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
          Dm            F     C G
That were lost to us forever
 
 
Em           Am               F        G      C
But you were history with the slamming of the door
      Em             Am              F   Gsus4 G
And I made myself so strong again somehow
      Em           Am        F       G         Fsus2
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then
 
         C
But if I touch you like this
           G/B
And if you kiss me like that
       Am7     Dm7
It was so long ago
         Fmaj7      Gsus4
But it's all coming back to me
       C
If you touch me like this
         G/B
And if I kiss you like that
       Am7           Dm7
It was gone with the wind
         Fmaj7      Gsus4
But it's all coming back to me
 
      C                                 F
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
           Am7        F
There were moments of gold
               Em         F
And there were flashes of light
           Am7              F
There were things I'd never do again
                Em            F
But then they'd always seemed right
           Am                Em7
There were nights of endless pleasure
        Am                F       Dm
It was more than all your laws allow
F/G
Baby Baby
 
 
         C
When you touch me like this
             G/B
And when you hold me like that
       Am7           Dm7
It was gone with the wind
         Fmaj7      Gsus4
But it's all coming back to me
         C
When you see me like this
           G/B
And when I see you like that
        Am7          Dm7
Then we see what we want to see
Fmaj7      Gsus4
All coming back to me
     Am7          Dm7
The flesh and the fantasies
Fmaj7      Gsus4
All coming back to me
      Am7    Dm7
I can barely recall
         Fmaj7      Gsus4      Am
But it's all coming back to me now
 
G/B  F  Dm    G/B  C/F  F  Dm
 
 
          C
If you forgive me all this
        G/B
If I forgive you all that
      Am7         Dm7
We forgive and forget
         Fmaj7      Gsus4
And it's all coming back to me
         C
When you see me like this
           G/B
And when I see you like that
       Am7          Dm7
We see just what we want to see
Fmaj7      Gsus4
All coming back to me
    Am7           Dm7
The flesh and the fantasies
Fmaj7      Gsus4
All coming back to me
      Am7    Dm7             Fmaj7      Gsus4      C
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now
 
 
                 Dm7
(It's all coming back to me now)
              C
And when you kiss me like this
                 Dm7
(It's all coming back to me now)
           C
And when I touch you like that
                 Dm7
(It's all coming back to me now)
       C
If you do it like this
                 Dm7
(It's all coming back to me now)
      G/B          C
And if we . . .
