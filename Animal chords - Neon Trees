capo 3
 
[Verse 1]
D
Here we go again
                         A
I kinda wanna be more than friends
 
So take it easy on me
G                   A               G
I'm afraid you're never satisfied.
D
Here we go again
 
we're sick like animals
        A
we play pretend
 
you're just a cannibal
G                                 A
and I'm afraid I wonâ€™t get out alive
      G
no I won't sleep tonight.
 
[Chorus]
D
Oh, oh
 
I want some more
A
Oh, oh
                       G
what are you waitin' for?
                             D
Take a bite of my heart tonight.
 
Oh oh
 
I want some more
F#m
Oh oh
                       G
what are you waitin' for?
                       A
what are you waitin' for?
                             D
Say goodbye to my heart tonight.
 
[Verse 2]
D
Here we are again
                             A
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
 
it's gettin heavier
    G
I wanna run and hide
A                    G
I wanna run and hide.
D
I do it every time
                    A
you're killin' me now
        G
and I won't be denied by you
         A
the animal inside of you.
 
[Chorus]
D
Oh, oh
 
I want some more
A
Oh, oh
                       G
what are you waitin' for?
                              D
Take a bite of my heart tonight.
 
Oh oh
 
I want some more
F#m
Oh oh
                        G
what are you waitin' for?
                        A
what are you waitin' for?
                              G
Say goodbye to my heart tonight.
 
[Bridge]
G
hush hush the world is quiet
A
hush hush we both can't fight it
G
It's us that made this mess
D                        A
why can't you understand?
            G               D  A  Bm
Woah I won't sleep tonight.
Bm                         D  A  G  D

                       G
