Capo: 1st fret

[Verse 1]
D
I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
Bm
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
G
Our every moment, I start to replace
Asus4                              A
‘cause now that they’re gone all I hear are the words that I needed to say
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D
When you hurt under the surface
Bm                            G
Like troubled water running cold
                            Asus4      A
Well time can heal but this won't
 
 
[Chorus 1]
D
So
            A
Before you go
               Bm
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
    G                             A
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
D
So
           A
Before you go
              Bm
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
    G
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
A
So
             D
Before you go
 
 
[Verse 2]
D
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Bm
Went little by little by little, until there was nothing at all
G
Our every moment, I start to replay
Asus4                        A
When all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D
When you hurt under the surface
Bm                            G
Like troubled water running cold
                            Asus4    A
Well time can heal but this wont
 
 
[Chorus 2]
D
So
            A
Before you go
              Bm
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
    G                            A
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
D
So
           A
Before you go
              Bm
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
    G
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
A
So
            Bm
Before you go
 
 
[Bridge]
Bm          G             D
Would we be better off by now?
       A                 Bm
If I'd let my walls come down?
        G                  A
Maybe I guess we’ll never know
A                  D
You know, you know
 
 
[Chorus 3]
            A
Before you go
              Bm
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
    G                            A
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
D
So
           A
Before you go
              Bm
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
    G
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
A
So
            D
Before you go
