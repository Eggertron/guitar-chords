Capo: 4th fret

[Verse 1]
C#m
  Counting days, counting days
                         A       E
Since my love up and got lost on me
C#m
  And every breath that I've been taken
          B                 A        E
Since you left feels like a waste on me
C#m
  I've been holding on to hope
                 G#m                A         E
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
C#m
  'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
          B                 A      E
Since you left feels like a hollow street
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A
  I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
C#m                            B
  But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
A                                          C#m   G#m
  Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side
 
 
[Chorus]
                               A C#m
There must be something in the water
                              G#m A
'Cause every day it's getting colder
                    B    C#m
And if only I could hold you
                              G#m A
You'd keep my head from going under
 
 
[Verse 2]
C#m                              B
  Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
       A        E
By the brighter side
C#m
  Of what we had because it's over
            G#m                A      E
Well, there must be something in the tide
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A
  I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
C#m                            B
  But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
A                                          C#m   G#m
  Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side
 
 
[Chorus]
                               A C#m
There must be something in the water
                              G#m A
'Cause every day it's getting colder
                    B    C#m
And if only I could hold you
                              G#m A
You'd keep my head from going under
 
 
[Interlude]
            A   C#m
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            G#m  A
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            B   C#m
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            G#m  A
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
 
 
[Bridge]
F#m
  It's your love I'm lost in
E
  Your love I'm lost in
C#m
  Your love I'm lost in
        B
And I'm tired of being so exhausted
F#m
  Your love I'm lost in
E
  Your love I'm lost in
C#m
  Your love I'm lost in
B                              A   C#m
Even though I'm nothing to you now
                               G#m  A
Even though I'm nothing to you now
 
 
[Chorus]
                               A C#m
There must be something in the water
                              G#m A
'Cause every day it's getting colder
                    B    C#m
And if only I could hold you
                              G#m A
You'd keep my head from going under
                               A C#m
There must be something in the water
                              G#m A
'Cause every day it's getting colder
                    B    C#m
And if only I could hold you
                              G#m A
You'd keep my head from going under
