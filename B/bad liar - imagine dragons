[Verse 1]
   D                         D
Oh hush my dear, it's been a difficult year
    Bm                    Bm
And terrors don't prey on innocent victims
G                 A                D
 Trust me darlin', trust me darlin'
 
            D
It's been a loveless year
      D
I'm a man of three fears
  Bm                 Bm
Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
G                 A                D
 Trust me darlin', trust me darlin'
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                  Bm
So look me in the eyes
                 G
Tell me what you see
            D
Perfect paradise
               A/C#
Tearing at the seams
                 Bm
I wish I could escape it
                G
I don't want to fake it
                D
I wish I could erase it
                  N.C.
Make your heart believe
 
[Chorus]
                  Bm
But I'm a bad liar
        G
Bad liar
            D
Now you know

Does happiness lie in a diamond ring
G
Oh I've been asking, for
A                           D
Oh I've been asking, for problems, problems, problems
 
[Verse 3]
  D                   D
I wage my war, on the world inside
  Bm                 Bm
I take my gun to the enemy's side
G
Oh I've been asking for (trust me darlin')
A                                              D
Oh I've been asking (trust me darlin'), for problems, problems, problems
