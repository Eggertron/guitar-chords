G                        D
I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Em                            D
buy all of the things I never had
G                             D                  
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Em                             D
smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
 

[Chorus]
 C             D      Em
Every time I close my eyes
    C             D        Em
I see my name in shining lights
C            D           D   D/C#  Em (walk down to low E)
A different city every night  oh    I 
     C                      D
I swear the world better prepare
                    Em
for when I'm a billionaire


LYRICS


Remix part of the song.


I wanna be a trillionaire so bad
an obscene amount of money i'd have 
i'd probably change my name to Mr. Obese Stacks
then I
would lace the lady in my life with the finer things
every finger would have a diamond ring 
even the sun would get jealous of the light you bring

If i was a millionaire
I wouldn't be mad
I'd pay all the bills off for my mom and dad
then I 
would take the rest and put it away
save it for a rainy day
maybe even for my future family.
