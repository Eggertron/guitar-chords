[Verse 1]
               G         C
When the bubblegum pops
              G        C
I want you to smile
                   G           C
And remember every good time
                       Bm      E
We had when skies were grey
             Am      D
My Bubblegum dear
            G            Em
Why are you crying?
                    Am     D
I’ll never let them take
             G     D    G
My Bubblegum away

[Chorus]
             Bm
And when the skies are all blue
                       Em
All I ever think of is you -
                 Bm
The world lights up at your smile
                                Em
And shines at the sound of your laugh
    C
And Bubblegum dear
                      D
I just want you to be here

[Verse 2]
               G            C
Every time the sun shines
                G        C
I need you here with me
                   G       C
And every time you smile
                       Bm     E
It fills my heart with joy
             Am     D
My bubblegum dear
             G          Em
I’m yours forever
                    Am       D
I’ll never let them take
             G     D    G
My bubblegum away

[Bridge]
Em           Bm7                  Cmaj7
And when the sun goes down, dear
    D7                  Gmaj7  G7  Am
The moon comes to shine
                     D6
But it can’t be more beautiful
          Cmaj7    Em      D
Than your blue glistening eyes
   D7
So smile for me Bubblegum

[Verse 3]
               G           C
When the bubblegum pops
              G          C
I want you to smile
                   G        C
And every time you smile
                   Bm       E
It takes my breath away
             Am        D
My Bubblegum dear
            G         Em
Why are you crying?
                    Am       D
I’ll never let them take
              G    C    D
My Bubblegum away -
