[Verse]
 
G             D
The dawn is breaking
Em                   C
A light shining through
G              D              Em            C
You're barely waking and I'm tangled up in you
     G    D   Em   C
Yeah
 
 
G             D
I'm open, you're closed
Em                 C
Where I follow, you'll go
G       D                 Em        C
I worry I won't see your face light up again
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         G                D
Even the best fall down sometimes
         Em                   C
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
            G                   D
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
    Em          C          G      D    Em   C
I somehow find you and I collide
 
G               D
I'm quiet you know
Em               C
You make a first impression
G               D                  Em            C
I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         G                D
Even the best fall down sometimes
         Em              C
Even the stars refuse to shine
           G                   D
Out of the back you fall in time
   Em          C            G
I somehow find you and I collide
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em  C D
        Don't stop here
Em  C D
        I lost my place
Em  C D                G  D  Em  C
        I'm close behind
 
G  D  Em  C
 
 
[Chorus]
         G               D
Even the best fall down sometimes
          Em                  C
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
            G                     D
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
      Em         C          G       D
You finally find you and I collide
 
 
[Outro]
 
      Em          C         G       D
You finally find you and I collide
      Em          C         G       D
You finally find you and I collide
      Em          C         G       D
      Em          C         G
