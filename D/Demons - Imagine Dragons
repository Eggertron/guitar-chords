Capo: 1st fret

[Verse 1]
          D
When the days are cold
         A
And the cards all fold
         Bm
And the saints we see
         G
Are all made of gold
            D
When your dreams all fail
         A
And the ones we hail
         Bm
Are the worst of all
          G
And the blood’s run stale
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D                    A
  I wanna hide the truth
                 Bm
I wanna shelter you
                      G
But with the beast inside
                        D
There’s nowhere we can hide
                    A
No matter what we breed
                       Bm
We still are made of greed
                    G
This is my kingdom come
               N.C.
This is my kingdom come
 
[Chorus]
D                   A
  When you feel my heat
              Bm
Look into my eyes
                      G
It’s where my demons hide
                      D
It’s where my demons hide
                A
Don’t get too close
             Bm
It’s dark inside
                      G
It’s where my demons hide
                      D
It’s where my demons hide
 
[Verse 2]
        D
At the curtain’s call
          A
It's the last of all
          Bm
When the lights fade out
         G
All the sinners crawl
         D
So they dug your grave
         A
And the masquerade
           Bm
Will come calling out
        G
At the mess you made
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D                      A
  Don’t wanna let you down
              Bm
But I am hellbound
                        G
Though this is all for you
                       D
Don’t wanna hide the truth
                    A
No matter what we breed
                       Bm
We still are made of greed
                    G
This is my kingdom come
           N.C.
This is my kingdom come
 
[Chorus]
D                   A
  When you feel my heat
              Bm
Look into my eyes
                      G
It’s where my demons hide
                      D
It’s where my demons hide
                A
Don’t get too close
             Bm
It’s dark inside
                      G
It’s where my demons hide
                      D
It’s where my demons hide
 
[Bridge]
(D)                     A
They say it’s what you make
                  Bm
I say it’s up to fate
                  G
It’s woven in my soul
                   D
I need to let you go
                           A
Your eyes, they shine so bright
                   Bm
I wanna save that light
                       N.C.
I can’t escape this now
                    D
Unless you show me how
 
[Chorus]
(D)               A
When you feel my heat
              Bm
Look into my eyes
                      G
It’s where my demons hide
                      D
It’s where my demons hide
                A
Don’t get too close
             Bm
It’s dark inside
                      G
It’s where my demons hide
                      D
It’s where my demons hide
