Same chords all the way through: Bm/G/D/D/  (alternative: Em/C/G - Em/C/G/D)

Bm
I can remember days
G
Things weren't always this way
D
I used to make you smile
D
If only for a while
Bm
But now I can't get through
G
There's no way I can lose
D
I know some days are hard
D
But must you make mine too

Bm           G
 Coz I can't stand it
              D
When you come home and we just fight for hours
Bm           G
 But I won't show it
             D
No I'll just hold my breath and keep it quiet

             Bm
Every little earthquake
             G                       D
Every little heartbreak going unheard
             Bm
Every little landslide
               G                  D
Catch it in my hand I won't say a word
               Bm
Every time you hurt me
                 G                  D
I know that it's working making you mine
              Bm
Every clap of thunder
              G                 D
Only makes me stronger on the inside
