                  F    Am G F
I was tired of my lady,
             Dm        C   G Dm7 C
we'd been together too long
            G      F      Am G F
like a worn out recording
     Dm       C     Em7 F C
of a favorite song. 

             Gm        F       Am G F
So while she lay there sleepin'
           Dm       C   G Dm7 C
I read the paper in bed
           Gm       F       Am G F
and in the personal columns
               Dm        C   Em7 F C
there was this letter I read. 


                 F       Am G F
If you like piña coladas
                Dm        C    G Dm7 C
and gettin' caught in the rain
          Gm       F    Am G F
if you're not into yoga
       Dm          C    Em7 F C
if you have half a brain 

            Gm             F       Am G F
if you like makin' love at midnight
       Dm       C     G Dm7 C
in the dunes of a cape
             Gm               F         Am G F
then I'm the love that you've looked for
   Dm           C    Em7 F C
write to me and escape.

                       F     Am G F
I didn't think about my lady, 
              Dm            C   G Dm7 C
I know that sounds kind of mean
          Gm      F    Am G F
But me and my old lady 
            Dm        C           Em7   F C
had fallen into the same old dull routine

      Gm          F     Am G F
So I wrote to the paper, 
           Dm       C  G Dm7 C
took out a personal ad
            Gm          F     Am G F
And though I'm nobody's poet, 
             Dm         C    Em7 F C
I thought it wasn't half bad.


                 F      Am G F
Yes, I like piña coladas
              Dm          C    G Dm7 C
and getting caught in the rain
         Gm       F           Am G F
I'm not much into health food, 
    Dm        C       Em7 F C
I am into champagne

            Gm          F        Am G F
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
              Dm         C      G Dm7 C
and cut through all this red tape
     Gm         F         Am G F
At a bar called O'Malley's
            Dm       C      Em7 F C
where we'll plan our escape.

                 F         Am G F
So I waited with high hopes
          Dm          C    G Dm7 C
and she walked in the place
            Gm         F       Am G F
I knew her smile in an instant, 
           Dm          C     Em7 F C
I knew the curve of her face

          Gm         F    Am G F
It was my own lovely lady 
         Dm        C      G Dm7 C
and she said, "Aw, it's you."
        Gm            F     Am G F
Then we laughed for a moment
     Dm        C          Em7 F C
and I said, "I never knew."


                   F      Am G F
That you like piña coladas
               Dm        C    G Dm7 C
and gettin' caught in the rain
         Gm         F    Am G F
And the feel of the ocean
       Dm        C        Em7 F C
and the taste of champagne

                Gm         F       Am G F
If you like making love at midnight
        Dm        C     G Dm7 C
in the dunes on the cape
           Gm        F         Am G F
You're the lady I've looked for, 
          Dm    C      Em7 F C
come with me and escape


F | Am G F | Dm | C | G Dm7 C | Gm
F | Am G F | Dm | C | Em7 F C |


                 F       Am G F
If you like piña coladas
                Dm        C    G Dm7 C
and gettin' caught in the rain
          Gm       F    Am G F
if you're not into yoga
       Dm          C    Em7 F C
if you have half a brain 

            Gm             F       Am G F
if you like makin' love at midnight
       Dm       C     G Dm7 C
in the dunes of a cape
             Gm               F         Am G F
then I'm the love that you've looked for
   Dm           C    Em7 F C
write to me and escape. 


                 F      Am G F
Yes, I like piña coladas
              Dm          C    G Dm7 C
and getting caught in the rain
         Gm       F           Am G F
I'm not much into health food, 
    Dm        C       Em7 F C
I am into champagne
