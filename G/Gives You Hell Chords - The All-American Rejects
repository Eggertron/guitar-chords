[Intro]

C    Am   F

C    Am   F

 

[Verse]

   C            Am            F

I wake up every evening

                       C

With a big smile on my face

       Am                  F

And it never feels out of place

    C                     Am            F

And you're still probably working

             C

At a 9 to 5 pace

    Am                  F

I wonder how bad that tastes

 

[Chorus]

                C

When you see my face

                   Am                      F

Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

                 C

When you walk my way

                  Am                        F

Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

 

[Verse]

    C                   Am                  F

Now where's your picket fence, love?

                       C

And where's that shiny car?

    Am                    F

And did it ever get you far?

     C               Am                 F

You never seemed so tense, love

                             C

I've never seen you fall so hard

 Am                   F

Do you know where you are?

 

[Pre-Chorus]

    G                Am

And truth be told, I miss you

    G                  F7

And truth be told, I'm lying

 

[Chorus]

                C

When you see my face

                  Am                         F

Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

                  C

When you walk my way

                  Am                        F

Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

              C                  Am                    F

If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well

            Am                    G

Then he's a fool, you're just as well 

                  F7

Hope it gives you hell

                    C         Am   F     C   Am  F

I hope it gives you hell

 

[Verse]

     C             Am                F

Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself,

                     C

"Where did it all go wrong?"

        Am                F

But the list goes on and on 

 

[Pre-Chorus]

    G                Am

And truth be told, I miss you

    G                  F7

And truth be told, I'm lying

 

[Chorus]

                C

When you see my face

                  Am                         F

Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

                  C

When you walk my way

                  Am                        F

Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

              C                  Am                    F

If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well

            Am                    G

Then he's a fool, you're just as well 

                  F7

Hope it gives you hell

 

[Bridge]

     Am

Now you'll never see

      F

What you've done to me

        C

You can take back your memories

        Em          Dm        C

They're no good to me

     Am

And here's all your lies

         F7

You can look me in the eyes

         Dm

With the sad, sad look

          G

That you wear so well

 

[Chorus]

(with variations)

                C

When you see my face

                                           F

Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

                 Am

When you walk my way

                  G                       C

Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

 

              C                                      F

If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well

            Am                    G

Then he's a fool, you're just as well 

                  C

Hope it gives you hell

 

                C

When you see my face

                                           F

Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

                 Am

When you walk my way

                  G                       C

Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

 

[Outro]

                   C                                           F

When you hear this song and you sing along, well, you'll never tell

               Am                G

And you're the fool, I'm just as well

                    C

I hope it gives you hell

                   Am                G                C

When you hear this song I hope that it will give you hell

             Am                 G                 C

You can sing along I hope that it puts you through hell
