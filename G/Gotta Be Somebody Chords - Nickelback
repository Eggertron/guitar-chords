C G Am F

 

 

[Verse]

C                           G

This time, I wonder what it feels like

                    Am                             F

To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of

 

But dreams just aren't enough

                           C                               G

So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling

                      Am                            F

The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene

 

Straight off the silver screen

 

 

[Pre-Chorus]

                      Am

So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end

                      F                            G

Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

 

 

[Chorus]

      C

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there

      G

Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares

Am

Someone to love with my life in their hands

        F

There's gotta be somebody for me like that

      C

Cause nobody wants to do it on their own

    G

And everyone wants to know they're not alone

        Am

There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere

        F

There's gotta be somebody for me out there

 

 

[Verse]

C                                      G

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight

                      Am                             F

And dammit this feels too right, it's just like déjà vu

 

Me standing here with you

 

 

[Pre-Chorus]

                      Am

So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end

                      F                            G

Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

 

 

[Chorus]

      C

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there

      G

Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares

Am

Someone to love with my life in their hands

        F

There's gotta be somebody for me like that

      C

Cause nobody wants to do it on their own

    G

And everyone wants to know they're not alone

        Am

There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere

        F

There's gotta be somebody for me out there

 

 

Am F D F

 

 

[Bridge]

    C                                          G

You can't give up, (when you're looking for) a diamond in the rough

                              Am

(because you never know) When it shows up, make sure you're holding on

F

Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on

 

 

[Quiet Chorus]

      C

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there

    G

And everyone wants to feel like someone cares

Am

Someone to love with my life in their hands

        F

There's gotta be somebody for me, oh

 

 

[Chorus]

C

Nobody wants to do it on their own

    G

And everyone wants to know they're not alone

        Am

There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere

        F

There's gotta be somebody for me out there

C

Nobody wants to be the last one there

      G

Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares

        Am

There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere

        F

There's gotta be somebody for me out there 

 

(End on C)
