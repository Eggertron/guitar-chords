[Verse 1]

G                 Cadd9

I'm staring out into the night,

G                     Cadd9

Trying to hide the pain.

G                  Cadd9

I'm going to the place where love

    Em                   D            Cadd9

And feeling good don't ever cost a thing.

        Em               D              Cadd9

And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain.

 

[Chorus]

G                D

Well I'm going home,

           Cadd9           D

Back to the place where I belong,

               Em              D                Cadd9

And where your love has always been enough for me.

G               D

I'm not running from.

    Cadd9                  D

No, I think you got me all wrong.

Em                   D              Cadd9

I don't regret this life I chose for me.

           Em               D                Cadd9

But these places and these faces are getting old,

                 G           Cadd9

So I'm going home.

                  G      Cadd9

Well I'm going home.

 

[Verse 2]

G                       Cadd9           G

The miles are getting longer, it seems,

                     Cadd9

The closer I get to you.

G                                    Cadd9

I've not always been the best man or friend for you.

                       Em

But your love remains true.

    D            Cadd9

And I don't know why.

Em                 D              Cadd9

You always seem to give me another try.

 

[Chorus]

G                 D

Well I'm going home,

           Cadd9           D

Back to the place where I belong,

               Em             D              Cadd9            D

And where your love has always been enough for me.

 

G               D

I'm not running from.

      Cadd9              D

No, I think you got me all wrong.

         Em          D               Cadd9

I don't regret this life I chose for me

            Em               D               Cadd9

But these places and these faces are getting old

 

 

[Bridge]

D                     Cadd9

Be careful what you wish for,

                             Em

'Cause you just might get it all.

     D               Cadd9

You just might get it all,

                         D

And then some you don't want.

                      Cadd9

Be careful what you wish for,

                             Em

'Cause you just might get it all.

          D           Cadd9

You just might get it all, yeah.

[Chorus]

G                D

Well I'm going home,

           Cadd9           D

Back to the place where I belong,

               Em              D              Cadd9

And where your love has always been enough for me.

G               D

I'm not running from.

      Cadd9              D

No, I think you got me all wrong.

Em                  D              Cadd9

I don't regret this life I chose for me.

          Em                 D                 Cadd9

But these places and these faces are getting old,

              Em               D               Cadd9

I said these places and these faces are getting old,

             Em   D Cadd9  Em D Cadd9

So I'm going home.

          G

I'm going home.
