Capo 3
 
 
Am                  C
Never made it as a wise man
G                     D/F#
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Am                  C
Tired of living like a blind man
G                         D/F#
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
Am             C       G
And this is how you remind me
Am          C        G            D/F#
This is how you remind me of what I really am
Am          C        G
This is how you remind me of what I really am
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am              C
It's not like you to say sorry
G                      D/F#
I'm always waiting on a different story
Am             C
This time I'm mistaken
G                 D/F#
For handing you a heart worth breaking
Am                   C
And I've been wrong, I've been down
G                 D/F#
Into the bottom of every bottle
Am              C
These five words in my head
G                D/F#
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"
Am     C     G    D/F#
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no
Am     C     G    D/F#
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am                       C
It's not like you didn't know that
G                       D/F#
I said I love you and I swear I still do
Am                     C
And it must have been so bad
G                              D/F#
Cause living with me must have damn near killed you
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
Am          C        G            D/F#
And this is how you remind me of what I really am
Am          C        G
This is how you remind me of what I really am
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am              C
It's not like you to say sorry
G                      D/F#
I'm always waiting on a different story
Am             C
This time I'm mistaken
G                 D/F#
For handing you a heart worth breaking
Am                   C
And I've been wrong, I've been down
G                 D/F#
Into the bottom of every bottle
Am              C
These five words in my head
G                D/F#
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"
