# Here Without You
Three Doors Down

```
[Verse 1]
 
          Am
A hundred days have made me older
          G                                      Am  F  G
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
           Am
A thousand lies have made me colder
      G                                        Am  F  G
And I don't think I can look at this the same
Am                          G
But all the miles that seperate
Am                           F                G
They dissapear now, when I'm dreaming of your face
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                              G
I'm here without you, baby
                                    Am
But you're still on my lonely mind
                         F           G                       C
I think about you, baby, and I dream about you all the time
                            G
I'm here without you, baby
                               Am
But you're still with me in my dreams
        F    G                    Am   G    Am  F  G
And tonight, there's only you and me, yeah
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
    Am
The miles just keep rollin'
       G                                    Am  F  G
As the people leave their way to say hello
                Am
I've heard this life is overrated
      G                              Am      F    G
But I hope that it gets better as we go, ohh yeah yeah
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                              G
I'm here without you, baby
                                    Am
But you're still on my lonely mind
                         F           G                       C
I think about you, baby, and I dream about you all the time
                            G
I'm here without you, baby
                               Am
But you're still with me in my dreams
        F    G                    Am   G    Am  F  G
And tonight, there's only you and me, yeah
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am                 C
Everything I know, and everywhere I go
G                         F
It gets hard but it won't take away my love
Am                           C
And when the last one falls, and when it's all said and done
G                          F
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love, whoa
 
 
[Interlude]
 
C        G        Am      F -- G
 
 
[Chorus]  (slightly altered)
C                           G
I'm here without you, baby
                              Am
But you're still on my lonely mind
                         F           G
I think about you, baby, and I dream about you all the time
C                           G
I'm here without you, baby
                               Am
But you're still with me in my dreams
    F              G                    C   G         Am
And tonight, girl, there's only you and me, yeah, ohh yeah
F   G     Am
Ohhh, I'm alone

And as I promised, the non-capo version :D
 
Is a bit more difficult, but is still easy.
