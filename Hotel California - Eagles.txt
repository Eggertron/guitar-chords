CAPO 2  


VERSE:
         Am                         E7
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
   G                         D               
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
  F                        C
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E
I had to stop for the night


Am                                 E7       
There she stood in the doorway;  I heard the mission bell
G                                     
And I was thinking to myself 
              D
This could be heaven or this could be hell
F                         C
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Dm
There were voices down the corridor, 
E
I thought I heard them say...


CHORUS:

F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
E7                   Am
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
F                                      C
There's Plenty of room at the Hotel California
     Dm                          E
Anytime of year,(anytime of year) You can find us here...

VERSE:

Her mind is Tiffany twisted, She got a mercedes benz
She got alot of pretty pretty boys that she calls friends
How they danced in the court yard sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember some dance to forget


So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
and still those voice are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night 
Just to hear them say


CHORUS:

F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
E7                   Am
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
F                                      C
There's Plenty of room at the Hotel California
     Dm                          E
Anytime of year,(anytime of year) You can find us here...

 
VERSE:
 
Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (an she said)
We are all just prisoners here , of our own device
and in the master's chambers, They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives but they
just can't kill the beast


Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had find the passage back to the place I was before 
"Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
You can check out anytime you like
But you can never leave...  


CHORUS 2: 

F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
E7                   Am
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
F                                      C
There's Plenty of room at the Hotel California
     Dm                          E
What a nice surprise; bring your alibis
