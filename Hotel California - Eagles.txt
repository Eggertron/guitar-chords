Hotel California chords
The Eagles  1976 (Hotel California)
 
[Verse 1]
 
Bm                        F#
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                      E
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
G                           D
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Em
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim,
F#
I had to stop for the night
 
Bm
There she stood in the doorway;
F#
I heard the mission bell
A
And I was thinking to myself,
              E
this could be heaven or this could be hell
G                                D
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
Em
There were voices down the corridor,
F#
I thought I heard them say...
 
[Chorus]
 
G                        D
Welcome to the hotel California;
       F#
such a lovely place,
       Bm
such a lovely face
G                               D
Plenty of room at the hotel California,
    Em                    F#
any time of year, you can find it here
 
[Verse 2]
 
Bm                           F#
Her mind is tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
A                                          E
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
G                                D
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Em                      F#
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
 
Bm
So I called up the captain,
F#
please bring me my wine
            A                                  E
He said, we haven t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine
G                                       D
And still those voices are calling from far away
Em
Wake you up in the middle of the night,
F#
just to hear them say
 
[Chorus]
 
G                        D
Welcome to the hotel California;
       F#
such a lovely place,
       Bm
such a lovely face
G                                     D
They re living it up at the hotel California
       Em                        F#
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
 
[Verse 3]
 
Bm
Mirrors on the ceiling,
F#
the pink champagne on ice
             A                               E
And she said we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
G
And in the master s chambers,
D
they gathered for the feast
Em
The stab it with their steely knives,
         F#
but they just can t kill the beast
 
Bm
Last thing I remember, I was
F#
running for the door
A
I had to find the passage back,
       E
to the place I was before
G
relax, said the night man,
       D
we are programmed to receive.
Em
You can checkout any time you like,
F#
but you can never leave!
