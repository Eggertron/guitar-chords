[Verse]
     Em     C G
You are my fire
     Em    C G
The one desire
     Em      C  G
Believe when I say
Em          D   G
I want it that way
    Em      C   G      Em
But we are two worlds apart
       C    G        Em
Can't reach to your heart
      C   G
When you say
     Em         D    G
That I want it that way

[Chorus]
         C
Tell me why
                    D     Em
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
         C
Tell me why
                    D    Em
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
         C
Tell me why
               D        G
I never wanna hear you say
Em         D    G
I want it that way

[Verse]
   Em     C G
Am I your fire
     Em     C G
Your one desire
      Em        C    G
Yes I know it's too late
    Em         D    G
But I want it that way

[Chorus]
         C
Tell me why
                    D    Em
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
         C
Tell me why
                    D   Em
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
         C
Tell me why
               D        G
I never wanna hear you say
Em         B
I want it that way

[Bridge]
Em                         G/D 
Now I can see that we're falling apart
          C                  Am    D
From the way that it used to be, yeah
     Em  
No matter the distance
  G/D 
I want you to know
      C                  D
That deep down inside of me...

[Verse]
     Em    D Em
You are my fire
     Em    D Em
The one desire
     Em
You are
             Cmaj7     G      Em               
You are, you are, you are    (I want it....)
