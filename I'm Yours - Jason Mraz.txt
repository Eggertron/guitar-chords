      C
Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it 
  G
I tried to be chill but your so hot that i melted 
  Am                                     F
I fell right through the cracks, and i'm tryin to get back 
C
before the cool done run out i'll be givin it my best test 
G
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention 
Am                             F
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some 


C            G
I won't hesitate no more, 
    Am              F
no more, it cannot wait i'm yours 


C                                   G
Well open up your mind and see like me 
                                    Am
open up your plans and damn you're free 
                                      F    
look into your heart and you'll find love love love 
C                                                  G
listen to the music at the moment maybe sing with me 
                     Am
Ah, la peaceful melody 
                                    F
It's your god forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved Loved
