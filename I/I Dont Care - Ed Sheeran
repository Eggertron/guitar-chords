[Verse 1]
G
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
G                                     Em
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Em
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
                                 C
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
C
Can you take my hand?
D                     G                          Em
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)
Em
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
D
You make it better like that
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G
Don't think I fit in at this party
Em
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
C
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
D
Who wants to fit in anyway?
 
[Chorus]
                 G
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
                         Em
All the bad things disappear
     Em                                              C
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
C                          D
I can deal with the bad nights
            D           G
When I'm with my baby, yeah
      G
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
                G
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
                    Em
You can take me anywhere
             Em                                        C
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
C                         D
I can deal with the bad nights
           D             G
When I'm with my baby, yeah
      G
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G
We at a party we don't wanna be at
G                                     Em
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Em
Press your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
                                 C
With all these people all around
C                          D
I'm crippled with anxiety
         D                                G
But I'm told it's where we're s'posed to be
           G                                           Em
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
                  D
And you make it better like that
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
G
Don't think we fit in at this party
Em
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
C
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mm
D
But now I think that we should stay
 
[Chorus]
                 G
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah

G
I don't like nobody, but it's like you're the only one here
G                                      D

G
I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
G                                   D
I don't like nobody but you, baby, yeah
