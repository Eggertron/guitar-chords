Capo: 1st fret

[Intro]
F G
 
 
[Verse 1]
      C
I was distracted and in traffic
          Dm7
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
                     F
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
                G
Were you in the livin' room, chillin' watchin' television?
           C
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
               Am
How to let you go and let communication die out
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am       G         C      Em           F  *
I know, you know, we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
Am      G         C      Em          F   *
I know, you know, we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
 
 
[Chorus]
                                       F
But if the world was ending you'd come over, right?
                          G
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
                          C
Would you love me for the hell of it?
                         Am
All our fears would be irrelevant
                                   F
If the world was ending you'd come over right?
                             G
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
                        C
And there wouldn't be a reason why
                      Am
We would even have to say goodbye
                                   F
If the world was ending you'd come over, right? 
     G
Right?
                            C
If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
     Am
Right?
 
 
[Verse 2]
           C
I tried to imagine your reaction
          Dm7
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
                     F
But it really got me thinkin', that night we went drinkin'
                G
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
                C
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
                       Am
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Am       G         C      Em           F  *
And I know, you know, we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
Am      G         C      Em          F  *
I know, you know, we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
 
 
[Chorus]
                                       F
But if the world was ending you'd come over, right?
                          G
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
                          C
Would you love me for the hell of it?
                         Am
All our fears would be irrelevant
                                   F
If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
                               G
The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
                        C
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
                      Am
We would even have to say goodbye
                                   F
If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
                      G                                                         C    Am
You'd come over, right? You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am       G         C      Em           F *
I know, you know, we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
Am      G         C      Em          F   *
I know, you know, we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
 
 
[Chorus]
                                       F
But if the world was ending you'd come over, right?
                          G
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
                          C
Would you love me for the hell of it?
                         Am
All our fears would be irrelevant
                                   F
If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
                               G
The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
                        C
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
                      Am
We would even have to say goodbye
                   F                             G
If the world was ending... you'd come over, right?
                                                        C
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?  Hmm
 
 
[Outro]
Am*
    If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
