Capo 2

[Intro:]
  C            Am7                          Em  
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky.

      C                 Am                    Em  G
And I swear, like the shadow that's by your side.


[Verse:]
C         F         G       C
I see the questions in your eyes,

              F        G           Am
I know what's weighing on your mind,

               F      Dm7/G   G
You can be sure I know my part.

        C        F        G           C
'Cause I stand beside you through the years,

            F         G      Am
You'll only cry those happy tears.

                C/G
And though I'll make mistakes,

D/F#                  Dm7/G  G
I'll never break your heart.

    Dm7                   Dm7/G       G

[Verse:]
C             F    G          C
I'll give you everything I can,

                F           G         Am
I'll build your dreams with these two hands,

                F               Dm7/G  G
We'll hang some memories on the walls.

    C             F      G           C
And when just the two of us are there,

                  F      G           Am
You won't have to ask if I still care.

              C/G
'Cause as the time turns the page

   D/F#              Dm7/G  G
My love won't age at all.

For better or worse, 'til death do us part,
