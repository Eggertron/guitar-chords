[Verse 1]
G
When I had you to myself
  C
I didn't want you around
      Em           C      G        Am        D    G
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
    G
But someone picked you from the bunch
    C
One glance was all it took
Em                C        G     Am     D      G
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Chorus]
G  D/F# Em      D        C     C/B  Am              D
Oh baby give me one more chance    (show you that I love you)
Em        C      G   Am D  G
Won't you please let me   (back in your heart)
G  D/F#    Em    D        C        C/B   Am         D
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go    (let you go baby)
    Em        C  G   Am  D      G
But now since I  see you in his arms (I want you back)

G
Yes I do now (I want you back)
Ooh ooh baby (I want you back)
Ya ya ya ya  (I want you back)
Na na na na

[Verse 2]
G
Tryin' to live without your love
   C
Is one long sleepless night
Em                    C  G
Let me show you girl
     Am     D          G
That I know wrong from right
G
Every street you walk on
  C
I leave tearstains on the ground
Em            C     G    
Following the girl
         Am   D     G
I didn't even want around, let me tell you now

[Chorus]
G  D/F# Em    D       C        C/B     Am              D
Oh baby all I need is one more chance (show you that I love you)
Em        C      G   Am  D   G
Won't you please let me     (back to your heart)
G  D/F#    Em    D        C       C/B    Am         D
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go    (let you go baby)
    Em        C  G              G  D/F#  Em D
But now since I  see you in his arms,    Uh-huh
