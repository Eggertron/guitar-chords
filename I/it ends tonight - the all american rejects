[Intro]
 
Am G F G
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am
Your subtleties
F
They strangle me
Dm              Em
I can't explain myself at all.
Am
And all that wants
F
And all that needs
Dm                  Em
All I don't want to need at all.
 
 
[PreChorus]
 
F
The walls start breathing
         C
My minds unweaving
C
Maybe it's best you leave me alone.
F            C
A weight is lifted
          Dm
On this evening
Dm
I give the final blow.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                      F
When darkness turns to light,
        Am
It ends tonight
        G
It ends tonight.
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am
A falling star
F
Least I fall alone.
Dm              Em
I can't explain what you can't explain.
Am                  F
Your finding things that you didn't know
Dm            Em
I look at you with such disdain 
 
 
[Pre Chorus]
 
F
The walls start breathing
         C
My minds unweaving
C
Maybe it's best you leave me alone.
F            C
A weight is lifted
          Dm
On this evening
Dm
I give the final blow.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        C               F
When darkness turns to light,
          Am
It ends tonight
          G
It ends tonight.
                 C                    F
Just a little insight will make this right
                 Am
It's too late to fight
           G
It ends tonight,
          F
It ends tonight.
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am      G
Now I'm on my own side
Dm                F
It's better than being on your side
Am         G                 Dm
It's my fault when you're blind
                    F                    Am
It's better that I see it through your eyes
            F              Dm
All these thoughts locked inside
              G
Now you're the first to know
 
 
 
[Chorus] x2
 
        C               F
When darkness turns to light,
          Am
It ends tonight
          G
It ends tonight.
                 C                    F
Just a little insight will make this right
                 Am
It's too late to fight
           G
It ends tonight,
          F
It ends tonight.
