[Intro] C - F - C - F
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
    C                        F
The strands in your eyes the color them wonderful
C                    F
Stop me and steal my breath
C                       F
Emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky
C                   (G)  F
Never revealing their depth
C             F
Tell me that we belong together
C                   F           (Gm)
Dress it up with the trappings of love
   C                    F
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
C                         G                        F       G
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above
 
 
[Chorus 1]
 
C        F
I'll be your crying shoulder 
C          F
I'll be love suicide
C        F
I'll be better when I'm older
C           G         F           C
I'll be the greatest fan of your life
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C           F
Rain falls angry on the tin roof
C                    F
As we lie awake in my bed
 
You're my survival, you're my living proof
C                   (G)   F
My love is alive not dead
C              F
Tell me that we belong together
C                   F            (Gm)
dress it up with the trappings of love
  C                    F              Gm
I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips
C                          G                   F        G
Instead of thr gallows of heartache that hang from above 
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
    C        F
And I'll be your crying shoulder .....
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
   Am
And I've dropped out, burned up, 
Gm                          F    G
Fought my way back from the deads
Am
Tuned in, turned on,
  Gm                          F    G
Remember all the things that you said
 
 
[Chorus 3]
 
C        F
I'll be your crying shoulder ....
 
 
 
END ! =D
