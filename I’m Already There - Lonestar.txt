 Capo 1

[Intro]
D Bm G E7sus4

[Verse 1]
   A                              Bm
 He called her on the road, from a lonely cold hotel room
        D                                  E7sus4 A
 Just to hear her say "I love you" one more time.
A                              G/B
 When he heard the sound of the kids laughin' in the background
          D                         E7sus4  A
 He had to wipe away a tear from his eye


[Pre-Chorus]
       Bm                             A
 Then a voice came on the phone, said "Daddy, when you comin' home?"
            D                Em7  G/B  D/F# G     
 He said the first thing that came  to  his  mind


[Chorus]
    A       D                  Bm
 I'm already there, take a look around
                         G                           D
 I'm the sunshine in your hair, I'm the shadow on the ground
        A              D                        Bm
 I'm the whisper in the wind, I'm your imaginary friend
      F#m              G            A       D     Bm G
 And I know I'm in your prayers, I'm already there


[Verse 2]
    A                             Bm
 She got back on the phone, said I really miss you darlin',
      D                                   E7sus4  A 
 Don't worry about the kids, they'll be allright.
A                              G/B
 Wish I was in your arms, lyin' right there beside you,
      D                                  E7sus4  A
 But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight.


[Pre-Chorus]
         Bm                               A              
 And I'll gently kiss your lips, touch you with my fingertips,
   D                   Em7 G/B   D/F# G     
 So turn out the light, and close your eyes.


[Chorus]
    A       D                   Bm
 I'm already there, don't make a sound,
                     G                                D
 I'm the beat in your heart, I'm the moonlight shining down,
        A              D                                 Bm
 I'm the whisper in the wind, and I'll be there 'till the end
        F#m                   G          A       D
 Can you feel the love that we share, I'm already there


Em     F#m  G
 We may be a thousand miles apart,
F           C             E7sus4   A    
 But I'll be with you, wherever you are


[Bridge]
            D                  Bm
 I'm already there, take a look around
                         G                           D
 I'm the sunshine in your hair, I'm the shadow on the ground
        A              D                                 Bm
 I'm the whisper in the wind, and I'll be there 'till the end
        F#m                   G
 Can you feel the love that we share,
     A      Bm    A G D/F# Em 
 I'm already there


[Tag]
