Capo 5

Intro:  C Am F C

C
 Oh her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining
Am
 Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
F                                       C
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

     C
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she wont believe me
Am
 And its so, its so sad to think she don't see what I see
F                                           C
 But every time she asks me do I look okay I say

Chorus:
                C                   Am
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              F                       C
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             C                      Am
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
                  F                        C
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are

C
 Her nails, her nails I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Am
 Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think its so sexy
F                                        C
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

        C
Oh you know, you know, you know Id never ask you to change
   Am
If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
F                                                        C
So, don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I say


Chorus

            C                Am
The way you are, the way you are
            F                       C
Girl you're amazing Just the way you are

                
Chorus
