E 
Yes I do, I believe

That one day I will be, where I was
                            Aadd9
Right there, right next to you

And it's hard, the days just seem so dark

The moon, the stars, are nothing without you


       E
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
                                           Aadd9
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you

The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside

These tears, they tell their own story


    F#m             A                C#m         B
You told me not to cry when you were gone
          F#m         A                      E     A/B
But the feelings overwhelming, it's much too strong
    E             C#m           F#m   A
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
     E                 C#m
And make sure you're alright
                  F#m
I'll take care of you, 
       A                       A/B                   E 
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight


        E
I'm reaching out to you
                 A
Can you hear my call?
      E
This hurt that I've been through
                                    A
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy


    F#m             A                C#m         B
You told me not to cry when you were gone
          F#m         A                      E/B    A/B
But the feelings overwhelming, it's much too strong
    E        B/D# C#m           F#m   A
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
     E                 C#m
And make sure you're alright
                  F#m
I'll take care of you, 
       A                       A/B                   F#m
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
