[Intro]
D, A, G x2
 
[Verse 1]
D
Top down in the summer sun
G
The day we met was like a hit and run
    Em                     A
And I still taste it on my tongue
(taste it on my tongue)
D
The sky was burning up like fireworks
G
You made me want you oh so bad it hurts
   Em                           A
But girl, in case you haven't heard
 
[Chorus]
              Bm
I used to be love drunk
              G
But now I'm hungover
                 D
I'll love you forever
            A
Forever is over
                Bm
We used to kiss all night
                 G
Now it's just a barfight
                 D
So don't call me crying
               A
Say hello to goodbye         
      G        A
Cause just one sip
      Bm        A
Would make me say
              Bm
I used to be love drunk
               G
But now I'm hungover
                 D
I'll love you forever
A
But now it's over
D              A    G
(hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!)
 
[Verse 2]
D
Hot sweat and blurry eyes
G
We're spinning on a roller coaster ride
      Em                     A
The world stuck in black and white
D
You drove me crazy every time we touched
G
Now im so broken that i can't get up
    Em                       A
Oh girl, you make me such a lush
 
[Chorus]
              Bm
I used to be love drunk
              G
But now I'm hungover
                 D
I'll love you forever
            A
Forever is over
                Bm
We used to kiss all night
                 G
Now it's just a barfight
                 D
So don't call me crying
               A
Say hello to goodbye         
      G        A
Cause just one sip
      Bm        A
Would make me say
              Bm
I used to be love drunk
               G
But now I'm hungover
                 D
I'll love you forever
A
But now it's over
 
[Breakdown]
G
All the time I wasted on you
D                             A
All the bullshit you put me through
G
I'm checking into rehab
G
Cause everything that we had
D                       A   G
Didn't mean a thing to youuuuuuuuu
 
(One strum)   Bm
I used to be love drunk
               G
But now I'm hungover
           D
I'll love you forever
A
But now it's over...........
 
Capo: 3rd fret (don't worry, there's time to switch it!)
 
[Chorus]
              Bm
I used to be love drunk
              G
But now I'm hungover
                 D
I'll love you forever
            A
Forever is over
                Bm
We used to kiss all night
                 G
Now it's just a barfight
                 D
So don't call me crying
               A
Say hello to goodbye         
      G        A
Cause just one sip
      Bm        A
Would make me say
              Bm
I used to be love drunk
               G
But now I'm hungover
                 D
I'll love you forever
A
But now it's over
