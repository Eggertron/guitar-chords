       C               Em          F         G
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
         C          Em       F       G
And then suddenly I bump into you
C                   Em                F         G
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
          C              Em              Am          G
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue
         Am
But with you
            But with you
        C
I found my place
        I see your face
         D                              F7
And it's nothing like I've ever known before
                C   Em  D  F7
Love is an open door
                C   Em  D  F7
Love is an open door
                C
Love is an open door
      Em            D
With you        With you
        With you        With you
F7              C   Em  F  G
Love is an open door
C   Em   F   G
            D
I mean it's crazy
   F#m                  G        A
We finish each other's              (that's what I was gonna say!)
                      Sandwiches
           D
I've never met someone
    F#m                 G    A
Who thinks so much like me
    D               F#m
Our mental synchronization
    G                 A
Can have but one explanation
D              F#m
You       Were
    And I      Just
         G      A
Meant to be
        Bm
Say goodbye
           Say goodbye
        D
To the pain of the past
E                         G7
We don't have to feel it anymore
                D   F#m  E  G7
Love is an open door
                D   F#m  E  G7
Love is an open door
                    D
Life can be so much more
       F#m           E
With you        With you
        With you        With you
G7
Love is an open
D     F#m  G  A  D  F#m  G  A
Door
    Door
