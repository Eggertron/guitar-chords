[Verse 1]
 
D
This may never start
AaddD              G
We could fall apart
                   D
And I'd be your memory
 
D
Lost your since of fear
AaddD              G
Feelings insincere
                   D
Can now be your memory
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D
Get back, back
                  G
Back to where we lasted
             Bm
Just like I imagined
               A
I could never feel this way
D
Get back, back
             G
Back to the disaster
                    Bm
My heart's beating faster
               A
Holding on to feel the same
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
D
This may never start
AaddD                G
I'll tear us apart
                 D
Cannot be your enemy
 
D
Losing half a year
AaddD                G
Waiting for you hear
                D
I'd be your anything
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D
Get back, back
                  G
Back to where we lasted
             Bm
Just like I imagined
               A
I could never feel this way
D
Get back, back
             G
Back to the disaster
                    Bm
My heart's beating faster
               A
Holding on to feel the same
 
D
This may never start
AaddD                G
Tearing out my heart
                   D
Can now be your memory
 
D
Lost your since of fear
AaddD                G
Feelings disappeared
                   D
Can now be your memory
 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D
Get back, back
                  G
Back to where we lasted
             Bm
Just like I imagined
               A
I could never feel this way
D
Get back, back
             G
Back to the disaster
                    Bm
My heart's beating faster
               A
Holding on to feel the same
 
D
This may never start
AaddD               G
We could fall apart
                   D
And I'd be your memory
 
D
Lost your since of fear
AaddD               G
Feelings insincere
                   D
Can now be your memory
