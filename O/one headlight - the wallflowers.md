# One Headlight
## The Wallflowers

```
[Verse 1]
G                      D
So long ago, I don't remember when
       F#7                          Bm     A
That's when they say I lost my only friend
          G                       D
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
     F#7                           Bm    A
As I listened through the cemetery trees
 
[Interlude]
G D F#7 Bm A
 
[Verse 2]
           G                     D
I seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn
    F#7                      Bm  A
The long broken arm of human law
       G                              D
Now it always seemed such a waste she always had a pretty face
  F#7                               Bm    A
I wondered how she hung around this place
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G G F#7 F#7
         Hey 
 
[Chorus]
G
   Come on try a little
D
   Nothing is forever
Em7                    A
   Got to be something better than
 
   In the middle
G
   Me & Cinderella
D
   Put it all together
   Em7              A   A7sus4
   We can drive it home
                G
   With one headlight
 
[Instrumental]
(G) D F#7 Bm A
 
[Verse 3]
              G
She said it's cold
                  D
It feels like Independence Day
      F#7                          Bm   A
And I can't break away from this parade
            G
But there's got to be an opening
D
Somewhere here in front of me
F#7                               Bm    A
Through this maze of ugliness and greed
               G
And I seen the sun up ahead
       D
At the county line bridge
       F#7                                 Bm   A
Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
      G
We'll run until she's out of breath
    D
She ran until there's nothin' left
    F#7                              Bm    A
She hit the end-it's just her window ledge
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G G F#7 F#7
         Hey hey
 
[[Chorus]]
 
[Instrumental]
(G) D F#7 Bm A
G D F#7 Bm A
 
[Verse 4]
                   G
Well this place is old
                     D
It feels just like a beat up truck
           F#7                            Bm   A
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
                  G
Well it smells of cheap wine & cigarettes
     D
This place is always such a mess
    F#7                                Bm   A
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
        G                              D
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
             F#7                             Bm   A
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
     G                            D
But somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams
  F#7                                Bm  A
I think her death it must be killin' me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G G F#7     F#7
    Hey hey hey
 
[[Chorus]]
 
[Outro]
G D Em7 A
(repeat and fade)
