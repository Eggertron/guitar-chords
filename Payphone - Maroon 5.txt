Cadd9 G Em Dsus4 – only chords

Cadd9                             G
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
Em                              Dsus4  
All of my change I've spent on you
                Cadd9                           
Where are the times gone baby
        G                               Em                        Dsus4
It's all wrong, we're at the place we made for two

[VERSE 1]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You said it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And then that time that you wasted
All of our bridges burnt down

[BRIDGE]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stucked in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[CHORUS]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I've spent on you
Where are the times gone baby
It's all wrong, we're at the place we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fuck'n love song I'll be sick

[VERSE 2]
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But just gave it away
You can't expect me to be a friend
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burnt down
[BRIDGE]

[Wiz khalifa]
Now work that sh-t
I'll be right here spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why wasn't you who came out from nothing
Made it from the botton
Now when you see me I'm struting
And all of my cause a way to push up a button
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone
So you never can call it
Don't need my name, or my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Shish, what a shame coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for it
Phantom roll out valet open doors
Where's the car way, got what you was looking for
Now ask me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of sh-t with you

[CHORUS]

Now I'm at a payphone…
