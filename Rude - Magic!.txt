Saturday morning jumped out of bed and put on my best suit
C          D                    Em              Em 
Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you
C          D                    G              Em
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand To ask you a question 
C          D                    G              Em
Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man yeah yeah

 C                                D
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?

say yes, say yes, Cause I need to know 
C                                D
You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die 
     G                    Em
Tough luck my friend but the answer is no!

[Chorus:]

 C             D          G              Em

G              Em     C      D    G     Em
Why you gotta be so rude

C          D                    G               Em
