[Intro] G D/F#
 
[Verse]
G                  D/F#
In a way, I need a change
                  Em
From this burnout scene
              D
Another time, another town
             C
Another everything
         D                 G
But it's always back to you
 
G                   D/F#
Stumble out, in the night
                 Em
From the pouring rain
                        D
Made the block, sat and thought
               C
There's more I need
     D                  G
It's always back to you
 
[Pre-Chorus]
        C        G
But I'm good without ya
          C        G
Yeah, I'm good without you
     D          D
Yeah, yeah, yeah
 
[Chorus]
G
How many times can I break till I shatter?
D/F#
Over the line can't define what I'm after
Em       D
I always turn the car around
G
Give me a break let me make my own pattern
D/F#
All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered
Em       D
I always turn the car around
 
[Verse]
G                      D/F#
I had no idea that the night
                   Em
Would take so damn long
                    D
Took it out, on the street
                     C
While the rain still falls
D                   G
Push me back to you
 
[Pre-Chorus]
        C        G
But I'm good without ya
          C        G
Yeah, I'm good without you
     D          D
Yeah, yeah, yeah
 
[Chorus]
G
How many times can I break till I shatter?
D/F#
Over the line can't define what I'm after
Em       D
I always turn the car around
G
Give me a break let me make my own pattern
D/F#
All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered
Em       D
I always turn the car around
 
[Solo] G      C D x2
 
[Bridge]
C                       G5
Give it up, give it up, baby
C                       G5
Give it up, give it up, now
D  C
Now
 
[Chorus]
G
How many times can I break till I shatter?
D/F#
Over the line can't define what I'm after
Em       D
I always turn the car around
G
All that I feel is the realness I'm faking
D/F#
Taking my time but it's time that I'm wasting
Em      D
I always turn the car around
 
G
How many times can I break till I shatter?
D/F#
Over the line can't define what I'm after
Em       D                  G5
I always turn the car around
 
[Outro]
            D                   G5
Don't wanna turn that car around
        D               G5
I gotta turn this thing around
