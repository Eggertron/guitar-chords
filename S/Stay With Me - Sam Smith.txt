[Opening]
C  F  C  F  Dm  C

[Verse 1]
Am                    F                                C
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
F                      Dm                          C
But I still need love cause I'm just a man
Am                         F                       C
These nights never seem to go to plan
F                            Dm                               C
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
                 Am     F    C
Won't you stay with me?
                  Am  F   C
Cause you're all I need
G             Am        F            C
This ain't love it's clear to see
          Ab      Am   F    C
But darling, stay with me

Am   F                       C       
       Why am I so emotional?
Am                F                                      C
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
Am                     F                           C
And deep down I know this never works
Am                            G                      C
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

[Chorus]
                 Am     F    C
Oh won't you stay with me?
                  Am  F   C
Cause you're all I need
G             Am        F            C
This ain't love it's clear to see
          Ab      Am   F    C
But darling, stay with me

[Bridge] (Same timing as the chorus)
                 Am     F    C
Oh....
                  Am  F   C
Oh...
G             Am        F            C
Oh...
          Ab      Am   F    C
Oh...

[Chorus]
                 Am     F    C
Won't you stay with me?
                  Am  F   C
Cause you're all I need
G             Am        F            C
This ain't love it's clear to see
          E      Am   F    C
But darling, stay with me

                 Am     F    C
Oh won't you stay with me?
                  Am  F   C
Cause you're all I need
G             Am        F            C
This ain't love it's clear to see
          Ab      Am   F    C
But darling, stay with me
