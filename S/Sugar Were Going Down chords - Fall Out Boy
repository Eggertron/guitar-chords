[Verse 1]
     D             G                  Bm
Am I more than you bargained for yet?
          G                 D
I've been dying to tell you anything
    G                   Bm                G
You want to hear, cause that's just who I am this week
D                G                Bm      G
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
           D                          G                        Bm     G
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
F#m    G          A   Bm
Drop a heart, break a name
              C         Bm                              G
We're always sleepin' in and we're sleepin' for the wrong team
 
 
[Chorus]
            D
We're going down down in an earlier round,
    G
And sugar we're going down swinging
             Bm
I'll be your number one with a bullet
  G
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
            D
We're going down down in an earlier round,
    G
And sugar we're going down swinging
             Bm
I'll be your number one with a bullet
  G
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it

[Verse 2]
        D             G                 Bm
Is this more than you bargained for yet
         G                     D                  G
Oh don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet
           Bm              G
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
D                  G                     Bm      G
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him
           D                          G                        Bm     G
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
F#m    G          A   Bm
Drop a heart, break a name
              C         Bm                              G
We're always sleepin' in and we're sleepin' for the wrong team
 
 
[Chorus]
            D
We're going down down in an earlier round,
    G
And sugar we're going down swinging
             Bm
I'll be your number one with a bullet
  G
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
            D
We're going down down in an earlier round,
    G
And sugar we're going down swinging
             Bm
I'll be your number one with a bullet
  G
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
 
 
[Bridge 1]
Em   D
       Down, down in an earlier round, and sugar we're going down swinging
G
I'll be your number one with a bullet, a loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
D
We're going down, down in an earlier round, and sugar we're going down swinging
G
I'll be your number one with a bullet, a loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
 
 
[Bridge 2]
            D
We're going down down  (down down)
            G
We're going down down  (down down)
            Bm
We're going down down  (down down)
  G
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
 
 
[Chorus]
            D
We're going down down in an earlier round,
    G
and sugar we're going down swinging
             Bm
I'll be your number one with a bullet
  G  N.C.
a loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
 
Em   D
