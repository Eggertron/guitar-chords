Intro:
C   Em     Am   F
   Hey Hey Hey Hey (2x)
 
 
Verse:
          C            Em
   Simmer down, simmer down,
                Am               F                 C
They say we're too young now to amount to anything else,
          Em
But look around,
          Am                 F                          C
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now.
                 Em
If you don't swim,
            Am
You'll drown,
              F (pause)
But don't move, honey.
 
 
Chorus 1:
     C                G
You look so perfect standing there,
       Am               F
In my American Apparel underwear,
    C         G
And I know now,
      Am        F
That I'm so down.
      C                    G
Your lipstick stain is a work of art,
           Am                   F
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart,
    C         G
And I know now,
      Am        F (pause)
That I'm so down...Hey Hey!
 
 
C  Em       Am  F
   Hey Hey Hey Hey (2x)
 
 
Verse:
           C              Em
Let's get out, let's get out,
             Am                   F                     C
'Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down,
             Em
While I was out,
   Am            F
I found myself alone just thinking,
   C                   Em
If I showed up with a plane ticket,
       Am                            F
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it,
       C                 Em
Would you wanna runaway too?
        Am                    F (pause)
'Cause all I really want is you.
 
 
Chorus 2:
     C                G
You look so perfect standing there,
       Am               F
In my American Apparel underwear,
    C         G
And I know now,
      Am        F
That I'm so down.
          C                        G
I made a mix tape straight out of '94,
               Am                       F
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor,
    C         G
And I know now,
      Am       F (pause)
That I'm so down...Hey Hey!
 
 
C   Em     Am  F
   Hey Hey Hey Hey (2x)
