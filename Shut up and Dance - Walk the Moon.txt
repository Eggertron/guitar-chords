[CHORUS]
              G           C
Oh don't you dare look back
                Em      D
Just keep your eyes on me.
                 G      C
I said you're holding back,
              Em        D
She said shut up and dance with me!
G    C             Em   D
This woman is my destiny
         G     C
She said oh oh oh
      Em       D
Shut up and dance with me

G C Em D X2

[VERSE 1]
           G    C          Em D
We were victims of the night,
           G      C          Em D
The chemical, physical, kryptonite
                 G         C      Em D
Helpless to the bass and faded light
             G             C
Oh we were bound to get together,
 Em            D
Bound to get together.

[BRIDGE]
    G       C
She took my arm,
     Em         D
I don't know how it happened.
G               C         D
We took the floor and she said

[VERSE 2]
               G             C          Em D
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,
               G             C          Em D
My discoth√®que, Juliet teenage dream.
               G             C          Em D
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me.
                G             C
I knew we were bound to be together,
 Em            D
Bound to be together.

 G           C
Deep in her eyes,
 Em        D
I think I see the future.
G     C     Em        D
I realize this is my last chance.
