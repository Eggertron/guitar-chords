G C Em D X2


           G    C          Em D
We were victims of the night,
           G      C          Em D
The chemical, physical, kryptonite
                 G         C      Em D
Helpless to the bass and faded light
             G             C
Oh we were bound to get together,
 Em            D
Bound to get together.

I don't know how it happened.

               G             C          Em D
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,
               G             C          Em D
My discothèque, Juliet teenage dream.
               G             C          Em D
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me.
                G             C

Deep in her eyes,
 Em        D
