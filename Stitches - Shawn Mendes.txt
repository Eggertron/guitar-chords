(Verse 1):
 Am             G               C        F
I thought that I've been hurt before
    Am              G                 C      F
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
 Am              G             C     F
Your words cut deeper than a knife
      Am                G                  C         F
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

(Pre-Chorus):
 F                       G 
Got a feeling that I'm going under
 Am
But I know that I'll make it out alive
 F                G
If I quit calling you my lover
Am
Move on
----------
(Chorus):
              Am                   G
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
           C                    F
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
             Am                 G
And now that I'm without your kisses
 F                 C
I'll be needing stitches
       Am           G
I'm tripping over myself,
             C                   F
I'm aching begging you to come help
       Am                      G
And now that I'm without your kisses
   F                C
I'll be needing stitches
-----------
(Verse 2):
  Am         G               C     F
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
          Am             G                 C          F
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
 Am           G                C           F
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
               Am          G
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
                C            F
I'm left seeing red on my own

(Pre-Chorus):
 F                       G 
Got a feeling that I'm going under
 Am
But I know that I'll make it out alive
 F                G
If I quit calling you my lover
Am
Move on
---------
(Chorus):
              Am                   G
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
           C                    F
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
             Am                 G
And now that I'm without your kisses
 F                 C
I'll be needing stitches
       Am           G
I'm tripping over myself,
             C                   F
I'm aching begging you to come help
       Am                      G
And now that I'm without your kisses
        F              C
I'll be needing stitches

(Bridge):
 Am             
Needle and the thread,
       G                  
Gotta get you out of my head
 C              
Needle and the thread,
       F         
Gonna wind up dead    (X3)
