Capo 2


G                                   Em
White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
      Csus4       G        Csus4
Burnt lungs, sour taste
G                                      Em
Light’s gone, day’s end, struggling to pay rent
     Csus4           G
Long nights, strange men
  

CHORUS:

Am7                              C                   G
And they say she’s in the Class A Team, stuck in her daydream
                    D                   Am7                          C
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting
               G                              D
Crumbling like pastries, and they scream the worst things in life come free to us
          Em                         Csus4          G                       
Cos we’re all under the upperhand, and go mad for a coupla' grams
Em                   Csus4       G
And she don’t want to go outside tonight
          Em                                  Csus4         G 
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland, or sells love to another man
Em          Csus4      G                  D      Em  C2  G           
It’s too co-old    out-side for angels to fly,          
              Em   C2   G    G/f#
for angels to fly


G                                          Em
Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim and stay afloat
    Csus4      G        Csus4
Dry house, wet clothes
G                                      Em
Loose change, bank notes, weary eyed, dry throat
     Csus 4   G
Call girl, no phone


CHORUS:

Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting
               G                              D
Crumbling like pastries, and they scream the worst things in life come free to us

Em          Csus4      G                  D      Em  C2  G           
It’s too co-old    out-side for angels to fly,          
              Em   C2   G    G/f#
for angels to fly



Am7           C               Em 
An angel will die, covered in white
       G                    G
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
Am7                      C        D                  Em   C   G  D
This time, we’ll fade out tonight, straight down the line

                    Em   C  G’  D
Straight down the line

for angels to fly

Or angels to die
