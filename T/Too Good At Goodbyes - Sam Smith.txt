Capo 5th fret
[Verse 1]
Am                          C
   You must think that I'm stupid
G                           Fmaj7
   You must think that I'm a fool
Am                          C
   You must think that I'm new to this
G                           F
   But I have seen this all before

[Refrain]
 Am
I'm never gonna let you close to me
 C
Even though you mean the most to me
 G                               Fmaj7
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
 Am
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
 C
Even when I mean the most to you
 G                                  F
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
                   Am                       C
And every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
                   G                            F
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
                   Am                        C
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
                       G                         F
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
                        Am
I'm way too good at goodbyes

(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
C                         G
  I'm way too good at goodbyes
                              F
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
Am                            C
   I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
G                             Fmaj7
   I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
Am                        C
   I'm just protectin' my innocence
G                         F
   I'm just protectin' my soul

[Refrain]
 Am
I'm never gonna let you close to me
 C
Even though you mean the most to me
 G                               Fmaj7
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
 Am
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
 C
Even when I mean the most to you
 G                                  F
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
                   Am                       C
And every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
                   G                            F
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
                   Am                        C
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
                       G                         F
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
                        Am
I'm way too good at goodbyes

(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
C                         G
  I'm way too good at goodbyes
                              F
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
                          Am
No way that you'll see me cry

(No way that you'll see me cry)
C                        G
  I'm way too good at goodbyes
                              F
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Bridge]
No
Am
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
C
No, no, no, no
G
No, no, no
                              F
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
Am                           C
  (No way that you'll see me cry)
Ahhh~
 G                            F
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Outro]
                    Am                      C
And every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
                   G                           Fmaj7
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
                   Am                        C
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
                       G                         F
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
                       C
I'm way too good at goodbyes
