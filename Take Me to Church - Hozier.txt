Verse 1
Em              Am  Em                       Am  G
 My lover's got humor, she's the giggle at a funeral
                         Am  Em                            Am  Em
Knows everybody's disapproval, I should've worshipped her sooner
                    Am       Em                     Am       G
If the Heavens ever did speak, she’s the last true mouthpiece
                        Am      Em                 Am      D
Every Sunday's getting more bleak, a fresh poison each week
                  C                
We were born sick, you heard them say it
Em                   Am      Em                              Am      G
 My church offers no absolutes, she tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
                        Am    Em                   Am     D
The only heaven I'll be sent to is when I'm alone with you
               C
I was born sick, but I love it. Command me to be well

What you got in the stable? We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty, that looks plenty, this is hungry work
