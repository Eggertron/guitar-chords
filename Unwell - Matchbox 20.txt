[Intro]
G   Cadd9   Em7   D   x2
 
[Verse 1]
Cadd9  D  G              Em7
All   day staring at the ceiling making
Cadd9        D             Em7
friends with shadows on my wall
Cadd9  D     G                  Em7
All    night I'm hearing voices telling me that
Cadd9                           D
I should get some sleep because tomorrow might be good for something
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm7    Cadd9   G                D
Hold   on  I'm feeling like I'm headed for a
Bm7    Cadd9     G            D
Break  down  and I don't know why
 
[Chorus]
    G                                Cadd9
But I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell  I know right now you can't tell
Em7                                    D
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see  a different side of me
G                                 Cadd9
I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired I know right now you don't care
Em7                                   D
But soon enough you're gonna think of me, and how I used to
 
[Verse 2]
Cadd9  D  G          Em7                  Cadd9   D              Em7
Be,    me talking to myself in public and dodging glances on the train
Cadd9   D       G                      Em7
and     I know I know they've all been talking about me
Cadd9                          D
I can hear them whisper and it makes me think there must be somethin' wrong
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm7   Cadd9  G              D
With  me     out of all the hours thinking
Bm7   Cadd9   G            D
Some  how     I've lost my mind
 
[Chorus]
    G                                Cadd9
But I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell  I know right now you can't tell
Em7                                    D
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see  a different side of me
G                                 Cadd9
I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired I know right now you don't care
Em7                                   D
But soon enough you're gonna think of me, and how I used to be
 
[Bridge]
Cadd9  Em7                       Cadd9
         I've been talkin' in my sleep
Em7                         Cadd9
pretty soon they'll come to get me
Em7                   D
yeh they're takin' me away
 
[Chorus]
    G                                Cadd9
But I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell  I know right now you can't tell
Em7                                    D
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see  a different side of me
G                                 Cadd9
I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired I know right now you don't care
Em7                                   D
But soon enough you're gonna think of me, and how I used to be
 
[Outro]
G  Cadd9                  Em7

D               G
   How I use to be yeah
Cadd9                  Em7
Well I'm just a little unwell
D                G
   How I used to be    (fade)
