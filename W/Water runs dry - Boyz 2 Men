[Verse 1]

C             G        Am   G
We don't even talk any more
C             G            Am    G
We don't even know what we argue about
C                 G            Am   G
Don't even say "I love you" no more
C             G          Am      G
Saying how we feel is no longer aloud


[Bridge]

F           E
Some people work things out and
Am               G          D/F#
Some just don't know how to change


[Chorus]

            F             Em         Dm
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
         F               Em            Dm
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
            Am            G          F   D/F#
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
               Dm         C           G
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives

                  C  G  Am G
Don't do it baby, ooh...

  C  G  Am G
 ooh...


[Verse 2]

C                G             Am   G
They can see the tears in our eyes
C                      G            Am           G
Cause we both have a pain that lies deep in our hearts
C                  G            Am     G
Well baby that's a pain we can hide
C               G                 Am       G
Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart


[Bridge 2]
F         E
Why do we hurt eah other?
Am        G          D/F# 
Why do we push love away?


[Chorus]

            F             Em         Dm
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
         F               Em            Dm
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
            Am            G          F   D/F#
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
               Dm         C           G
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives

                  C  G  Am G

  C  G  Am G
