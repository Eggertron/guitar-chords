   Capo on 3rd

   Em         G A D
I'm wide awake
   Em         G A D
I'm wide awake
   Em         G A D
I'm wide awake
Em               G 
Yeah, I was in the dark
      D              
I was falling hard
      A 
With an open heart
      Em
I'm wide awake
 G              D               A
How did I read the stars so wrong
    Em
I'm wide awake
      G  
And now it's clear to me
      D   
That everything you see
   A
Ain't always what it seems
  Em
I'm wide awake
G           D             A
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

(Pre-Chorus)
   Em
I wish I knew then
   G
What I know now
   D
Wouldn't dive in
   A
Wouldn't bow down
   Em
Gravity hurts
             G
You made it so sweet
             D
Till I woke up on
             A
On the concrete

(Chorus)
Em          G      D    A
Falling from cloud 9
Em         G      D     A
Crashing from the high
Em          G     D     A
I'm letting go tonight
        Em         G      D        A
(Yeah I'm) Falling from cloud 9
  Em
I'm wide awake
           G 
Not losing any sleep
             D
I picked up every piece
        A
And landed on my feet
     Em
I'm wide awake
    G              D              A
Need nothing to complete myself - nooohooo
   Em
I'm wide awake
       G
Yeah, I am born again
       D
Outta the lion's den
       A
I don't have to pretend
       Em
And it's too late
   G         D           A
The story's over now, the end

(Pre-Chorus)
      Em
I wish I knew then
      G
What I know now
      D
Wouldn't dive in
      A
Wouldn't bow down
      Em
Gravity hurts
      G
You made it so sweet
      D
Till I woke up on
       A
On the concrete

(Chorus)
    Em     G      D      A
Falling from cloud 9
    Em     G      D      A
Crashing from the high
    Em     G      D      A
I'm letting go tonight (yeah, I'm letting go)
    Em     G      D      A
I'm Falling from cloud 9
    Em      G
Thunder rumbling
    D       A 
Castles crumbling
   Em    G    D     A
I am trying to hold on
   Em        G
God knows that I tried
   D         A 
Seeing the bright side
    Em     G      D     A 
But I'm not blind anymore...
   Em   G  D  A
I'm wide awake
Em   G  D  A
I'm wide awake

(Chorus)
       Em  G    D         A
Yeah, I'm Falling from cloud 9
Em     G        D        A
Crashing from the high
Em        G        D       A
You know I'm letting go tonight
Em      G       D      A
I'm Falling from cloud 9
Em             G      D       A
I'm wide awake
Em             G      D       A
I'm wide awake
Em             G      D       A
I'm wide awake
Em             G      D       A
I'm wide awake
Em             G      D       A
I'm wide awake
