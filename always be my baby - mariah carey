INTRO: G
I verse
G
We were as one babe
Em
For a moment in time
C
And it seemed everlasting
Am                   D
That you would always be mine

G
Now you want to be free
Em
So I'm letting you fly
C
Cause I know in my heart babe
Am                  D
Our love will never die NO!

CHORUS:
G
You'll always be a part of me
C
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Em
Girl don't you know you can't escape me
C            D                         G
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
G
And we'll linger on
C
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
Em
No way you're never gonna shake me
C             D                       G
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby

II verse
G
I ain't gonna cry no
Em
And I won't beg you to stay
C
If you're determined to leave girl
Am                  D
I will not stand in your way
G                Em
But inevitably you'll be back again
C
Cause ya know in your heart babe
Am             D
Our love will never end no

G
You'll always be a part of me

I'm part of you indefinitely
Em
Girl don't you know you can't escape me
C             D                        G
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby

And we'll linger on

Time can't erase a feeling this strong
Em
No way you're never gonna shake me

Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
