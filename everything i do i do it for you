C G F G

C                           G
Look into my eyes, you will see 
F                G
What you mean to me 
            C                  G
Search your heart, search your soul 
    F                             C         G
And when you find me there you'll search no more 

      Dm                     C      Dm
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for 
                                 C     Dm
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for 
              C
You know it's true 
             G               C
Everything I do, I do it for you 

C                              G
Look into your heart, you will find 
        F                G                
There's nothin' there to hide 
             C           G
Take me as I am, take my life 
        F                    C    G
I would give it all, I would sacrifice 

      Dm                     C      Dm
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for 
                                 C     Dm
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for 
              C
You know it's true 
             G               C
Everything I do, I do it for you 

        Bb            Eb
There's no love, like your love 
       Bb                F
And no other, could give more love 
        C               G
There's nowhere, unless you're there 
        D             G
All the time, all the way 

F C F C
               Dm                            G
Oh - you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
        D                               G   F
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more 
        C                  G
I would fight for you, I'd lie for you 
         F                    Fm
Walk the wire for you, ya I'd die for you 

             C
Ya know it's true 
             G  F            C
Everything I do, I do it for you
