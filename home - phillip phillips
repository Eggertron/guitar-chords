Intro: C, F, C, F

Verse:
C      F             C     F
Hold on to me as we go
     C         F                C       F
As we role down this unfamiliar road
                       Am    F                C         F
Although this weight is stringing us along
         C, G/B, Am, G, Am
Just know you're not alone
               F, C/E, G,           C
Cuz I'm gonna make this place your home

Chorus:
C          F               C          F
Settle down it will all be clear
C                        F                          C         F
Don't pay no mind to the demons they fill you with fear
Am                       F
Trouble it might drag you down
           C                      G
If you get lost you can always be found
         C, G/B, Am, G, Am
Just know you're not alone
              F, C/E, G,            C
Cuz I'm gonna make this place your home
