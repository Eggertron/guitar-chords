Honey why you callin me so late
A                  Bm         G   D
It's kinda hard to talk right now
A             Bm            G       D
Honey why you cryin? Is everything ok?
A                       Bm           G        
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud

                               D
                Comin from the lips of an angel
                A
                Hearin those words
                   Cadd9            G
                It makes me weak
                    (D)
                And I
                                      (A)
                Never want to say goodbye
                                     (Bm)                 (G...)
