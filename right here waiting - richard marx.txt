[Intro]
C-G-Am-F-G


[Verse]
C        G              Am
 Oceans apart day after day
      F      G    C
And I slowly go insane
C            G            Am
 I hear your voice on the line
       F       G        Am
But it doesn't stop the pain

Am            F
 If I see you next to never
Am          F
 How can we say forever


[Chorus]
C             G
 Wherever you go
             Am
Whatever you do
Am        F          G           C
I will be right here waiting for you
            G
Whatever it takes
                Am
Or how my heart breaks
          F          G           C
I will be right here waiting for you


[Verse]
C           G                Am
 I took for granted, all the times
       F             G       C
That I though would last somehow
C        Am                F
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
G                       Am
But I can't get near you now

Am            F
Oh, can't you see it baby
Am            F
You've got me goin' crazy


[Chorus]
C             G
 Wherever you go
             Am
Whatever you do
Am        F          G           C
I will be right here waiting for you
            G
Whatever it takes
                Am
Or how my heart breaks
          F          G           C
I will be right here waiting for you


[Bridge]
Dm7       C             F
 I wonder how we can survive

This romance
Dm7         C               F
 But in the end if I'm with you
              G
I'll take the chance

C-G-Am-F-G

Am            F
Oh, can't you see it baby
Am            F
You've got me goin' crazy


[Chorus]
C             G
 Wherever you go
             Am
Whatever you do
Am        F          G           C
I will be right here waiting for you
            G
Whatever it takes
                Am
Or how my heart breaks
          F          G           C
I will be right here waiting for you
