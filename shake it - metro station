B                         C#m                   E          A

B                     C#m                E       A
Your body's cold, but girl we're getting so warm
B                     C#m               E      A
And I was thinking of ways that I could get inside (get inside)
B                              C#m  E
Tonight you're falling in love     (let me go now)

The feelings stirring me up (here we go now)
 
[Pre-Chorus]
B                                     C#m        E

Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back
B                                    C#m          E

B                          C#m           E             A

B                        C#m                E          A
your on the bed but your clothes are laying right there
B                     C#m         E        A
And I was thinking of places that I could hide
B                              C#m  E
Tonight you're falling in love     (let me go now)
A

 A                                     B
(I could tell that you could tell that I was taking my time)
E                 C#m
I was thinking of ways that you would stay and be mine
 A                            B
(You're body's shaking, turn me on, so I can turn out the lights)
