[Intro]

C


[Verse 1]

C                 Am
I'm not a perfect person
                               C
As many things I wish I didn't do
               Am
But I continue learning
                                   F
I never meant to do those things to you
                              G
And so I have to say before I go
                          C
That I just want you to know


[Chorus]

                       Am
I've found a reason for me
                        F
To change who I used to be
                        G
A reason to start over new
                   C
and the reason is you


[Verse 2]

C                   Am
I'm sorry that I hurt you
                                     C
It's something I must live with everyday
                           Am
And all the pain I put you through
                                  F
I wish that I could take it all away
                                     G
And be the one who catches all your tears
                          C
That's why I need you to hear


[Chorus]  

                       Am
I've found a reason for me
                        F
To change who I used to be
                        G
A reason to start over new


[Bridge]

                   Bb
and the reason is you 
                   C
and the reason is you 
                   Bb
and the reason is you
                   C
and the reason is you


[Verse 3]

C                    Am  
I'm not a perfect person
                                    F                                   
I never meant to do those things to you
                              G
And so I have to say before I go
                         C
That I just want you to know


[End Chorus]     

                         Am
I've found a reason for me
                         F
To change who I used to be                              
                       G
A reason to start over new
                  C
and the reason is you 

                        Am
I've found a reason to show
                        F
A side of me you didn't know                            
                        G
A reason for all that I do
                  C
and the reason is you
